ðŸ˜… I am currently a first-year Master's student at Shandong University. My research interests locate in piezoelectric actuation and its application to precise manipulation, and soft robotics. 

Specifically, For the past three years, I have engaged in piezoelectric actuation, specifically with ultrasonic motors and piezoelectric actuators. I focus on developing driving circuits and control systems, as well as in designing mechanical structures for actuators. I have published four first-author papers in SCI journals (IEEE TIE, SNA, SMS, etc.).

I am now more interested in soft robotics, which will be my topic of my Ph.D. career. In summer 2025, I will join Prof. Mihai Duduta's lab at UConn, where I will have a three-month summer research programme about soft robotics.
