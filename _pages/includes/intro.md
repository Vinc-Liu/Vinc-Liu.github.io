:smile: I am currently a first-year postgraduate student at Shandong University. My research interests locate in piezoelectric actuation and its application to precise manipulation. 

Specifically, I have worked on ultrasonic motors, focusing on designing mechanical structure and developing vibration modes to achieve high performance. At present, I am specializing in **piezoelectric actuators**, especially in structure configuration, actuation strategy, and driving circuits.
