:smile: I am currently a first-year postgraduate student at Shandong University. My research interests locate in piezoelectric actuation and its application to precise manipulation. 

Specifically, in the past, I have worked on ultrasonic motors, focusing on innovations in their mechanical structure and vibration modes to achieve high performance. At present, I am focusing on piezoelectric actuators, with an emphasis on the development of their mechanical structure, actuation strategies, and driving circuits.

Previous Researches
======
1. Polymer-based ultrasonic actuator with high-order vibration mode
2. Piezoelectric actuator driven by resonant-vibration-induced stick-slip motion
3. Ultrasonic actuator driven by torsional-vibration-induced flexural traveling waves

Current Researches
======
1. High-power miniature driving circuit for piezoelectric actuators
2. Development of high-performance piezoelectric actuators/ultrasonic motors

Ongoing Plans
======
1. Looking for a top summer research program in the United States, preferably focused on soft robotics. Piezo-related program is also acceptable.
2. Do more researches, publish more papers, and be more competitive.
3. IELTS for 7.0+
4. Striving for a top phd program in the United States/Europe, preferably focused on soft robotics.
