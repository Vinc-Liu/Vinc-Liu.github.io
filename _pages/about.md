I study at Shandong University as a first-year postgraduate now.

I am now working on piezoelectric actuators, ultrasonic motors, and high-power/miniature driving circuit. I am now pursuiting the 2025 summer research programm, learning more knowledge, and doing more practice.  I intend to apply for a Ph.D. program in the United States or Europe in the future.

Previous Researches
======
1. Polymer-based ultrasonic actuator with high-order vibration mode
2. Piezoelectric actuator driven by resonant-vibration-induced stick-slip motion
3. Ultrasonic actuator driven by torsional-vibration-induced flexural traveling waves
