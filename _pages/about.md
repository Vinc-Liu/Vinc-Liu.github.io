I study at Shandong University as a first-year postgraduate now.

I am now working on piezoelectric actuators, ultrasonic motors, and high-power/miniature driving circuit. I am now pursuiting the 2025 summer research programm, learning more knowledge, and doing more practice.  I intend to apply for a Ph.D. program in the United States or Europe in the future.

Previous Researches
======
1. Polymer-based ultrasonic actuator with high-order vibration mode
2. Piezoelectric actuator driven by resonant-vibration-induced stick-slip motion
3. Ultrasonic actuator driven by torsional-vibration-induced flexural traveling waves

Current Researches
======
1. High-power miniature driving circuit for piezoelectric actuators
2. Development of high-performance piezoelectric actuators/ultrasonic motors

Ongoing Plans
======
1. Looking for a top summer research program in the United States, preferably focused on soft robotics. Piezo-related program is also acceptable.
2. Do more researches, publish more papers, and be more competitive.
3. IELTS for 7.0+
4. Striving for a top phd program in the United States/Europe, preferably focused on soft robotics.
