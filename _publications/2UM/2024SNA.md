d1: 'A bonded-type ultrasonic motor is developed inspired by the centipede; this is a feature in the bionic aspect.'
d2: 'The motor is driven by flexural travelling wave, which is excited by dual second-order torsinal vibrations; this is a feature in the technical aspect.'
d3: 'The motor produces the speed, the thrust force, the output power, and the efficiency of 630 mm/s, 4.38 N, 527.8 mW, and 21.3 %, respectively. Moreover, it yields the thrust force density and the power density of 151.2 N/kg and 18.2 W/kg, respectively.'
