d1: 'A bonded-type ultrasonic motor driven by flexural travelling waves (excited by 2nd torsional vibrations)is developed inspired by the centipede.'
d2: 'The motor produces the speed, the thrust force, the thrust force density and the power density of 630 mm/s and 4.38 N, 151.2 N/kg and 18.2 W/kg, respectively.'
