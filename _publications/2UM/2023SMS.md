d1: 'A rotary ultrasonic motor is developed by employing a PPS/CF-based vibrator, which is driven by hybrid mode composed by the 3rd bending vibration in the θ axis and the 1st longitudinal vibration in the z axis.'
d2: 'The PPS/CF is used as the material of the vibrator, which is a low-density functional polymer with anisotropically elastic moduli. The vibrator's un-slotted thickness and the carbon fiber filling direction is crucial to the performance, where structural optimization is performed.'
d3: 'The PPS/CF-based motor yielded the torque density and power density of respectively 7.1 Nm·kg<sup>−1</sup> and 17.1 W·kg<sup>−1</sup>, exceeding the values of conventional polymer-based USMs.'
