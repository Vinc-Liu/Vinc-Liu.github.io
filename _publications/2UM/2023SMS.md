d1: 'A rotary ultrasonic motor is developed by employing a PPS/CF-based vibrator, which is driven by high order hybrid mode.'
d2: 'The anisotropically elastic moduli of the PPS/CF makes it possible to enhance the motor's performance by changing the carbon fiber filling direction.'
d3: 'The motor yielded the torque density and power density of respectively 7.1 Nm·kg^{−1} and 17.1 W·kg^{−1}.'
