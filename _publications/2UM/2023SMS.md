d1: 'A rotary ultrasonic motor is developed by employing a PPS/CF-based vibrator, which is driven by hybrid mode (/theta,z) = (3,1)'
d2: 'The PPS/CF is used as the material of the vibrator, which is a low-density functional polymer with anisotropically elastic moduli. '
d3: 'The PPS/CF-based motor yielded the torque density and power density of respectively 7.1 Nm·kg^(−1) and 17.1 W·kg^(−1), exceeding the values of conventional polymer-based USMs.'
