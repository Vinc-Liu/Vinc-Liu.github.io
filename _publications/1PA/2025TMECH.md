d1: 'Tailored to the vibration distributions, the angle of each portion of the non-uniformly distributed electrode as well as its applied frequency/voltage are decided to balance the electromechanical coupling properties of the B4 and B3 vibrations.'
d2: 'The tethered actuator has the maximal payload of 5130 g (156.4 times its weight) and the maximal resolution of 117 nm and 2.4 Î¼rad; the untethered actuator exhibits the speed of 156.4 mm/s and 23.5 rad/s.'
