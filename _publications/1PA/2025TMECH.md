d1: 'The ring-shaped electrode was divided non-uniformly to balance the electromechanical coupling properties of the B3 and B4 vibrations.'
d2: 'The 4th-order bending (B4) and 3rd-order bending (B3) vibrations are excited to generate the translational and rotational movements, respectively, inspired by the kangarooâ€™s walking and rotating gaits.'
d3: 'The actuator exhibits the speed of 138.2 mm/s and 23.5 rad/s, the maximal payload of 5130 g (156.4 times its weight)'
