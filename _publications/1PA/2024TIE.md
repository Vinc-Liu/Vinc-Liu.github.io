d1: 'A piezoelectric actuator (SMPA) with high carrying/positioning capability is developed, which is driven by integration of resonant vibration and stick-slip principle.'
d2: 'In a tethered manner, it yields the maximal speed of 224.1 mm/s, the maximal payload of 1130 g (equal to 29.3 times of its weight). In a untethered manner, the homemade onboard circuit makes it produce minimal step displacement of 12.2 nm and stroke of 9.16 m.'
d3: 'SMPA exhibits potential application to cell puncture owing to the two-DOF untethered movement.'
